# DayRec
DayRec (now renamed to WhatsThePlan) is the original final project for Mobile Apps Company.  

It is an iOS application developed in Swift 2.2 that lets users add recommendations and day plans for any given city.  
Users can search by cities and find other user day plans for what to do in the city.  
Each recommendation provides another user's unique take on the city as well as which locations are a must do.


DayRec is first version of the eventual app - WhatsThePlan.  New changes/features will be added to the WhatsThePlan application in future releases.
